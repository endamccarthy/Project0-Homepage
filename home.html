                    <h3>Summary</h3>
                    <p>
                        Currently up-skilling in computer science having spent 4 years working as an electrical engineer with Arup Consulting Engineers.
                        </br></br>
                        I left Arup in December 2018 to pursue a career change. I am currently self studying and will enrol in a full time software 
                        development course in September 2019.
                        </br></br>
                        I was employed by Arup in the Cork office after my graduation in 2014. I spent just over 3 years in Cork (including a 3 month 
                        assignment in the Singapore office) before attaining a long-term assignment to the Dubai office where I spent just over 1 year.
                        </br></br>
                        I have very high standards in terms of quality. Reviewing and checking work has always been a high priority for me. 
                        One of my strongest skillsets is my ability to learn and adapt to new software programs and technologies.

                    <h5>Electrical Engineer, Arup Dubai (Oct 2017 – Dec 2018)</h5>
                    <p>
                        Much of my time in Dubai was spent in the role of project engineer on site in Abu Dhabi. 
                        I also worked on various other projects ranging from detailed designs to peer reviews.
                        </br></br>
                        Some of my duties included:
                        <ul class="paragraphList">
                            <li>Resolving various design issues on site and carrying out daily site inspections.</li>
                            <li>Responding to contractor submittals, i.e. RFI's, material approvals, shop drawings, etc.</li>
                            <li>Attending progress meetings involving the client, contractor and project management.</li>
                            <li>Developing detailed electrical designs using the Revit software program (4D building information modelling software).</li>
                            <li>Preparing reports and presentations.</li>
                            <li>Carrying out peer reviews of electrical systems on final detailed designs. </li>
                        </ul>
                    </p></br>
                    <h5>Electrical Design Engineer, Arup Cork (Aug 2014 – Oct 2017)</h5>
                    <p>
                        The majority of these 3 years was spent working on the detailed electrical design of several metro stations located in 
                        the Middle East. I also worked on various other detailed design projects including a confidential hospital project.
                        </br>
                        I gained an in-depth knowledge of the use of Revit throughout this time. I also became familiar with a visual programming 
                        software called Dynamo BIM, this software enabled us to access the Revit API and create scripts (using Python) to 
                        automate any number of processes in Revit.
                        </br></br>
                        My duties throughout the 3 years in Cork included developing:
                        <ul class="paragraphList">
                            <li>Fire alarm designs including loop schedules and schematics.</li>
                            <li>Small power designs including Amtech calculations.</li>
                            <li>Normal and emergency lighting designs including DIALux calculations. </li>
                            <li>Electrical schematics and maximum demand calculations.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p></br>
                    <h5>Apprentice Electrician, ESB Networks, Ireland (Sep 2009 – Sep 2011)</h5>
                    <p>
                        I joined ESB Networks in 2009 as an apprentice electrician after finishing secondary school. There was a programme in 
                        place at the time which would see a select few apprentices receive scholarships to pursue an engineering degree at 
                        some point during their apprenticeship. I successfully obtained an ESB scholarship and was enrolled in 2nd year of 
                        electrical engineering in Cork IT in September 2011. 
                        </br></br>
                        Some of my duties included the construction and maintenance of HV, MV and LV networks (both overhead and underground), 
                        panel wiring in sub-stations, new customer connections, urban network renewal and storm damage repair.
